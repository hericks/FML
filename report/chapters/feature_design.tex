To see how many features there are, we designed a function that creates a dummy state and returns the number of features.

This makes it easier to debug problems.

\subsection{Shortest path algorithms}
Now we needed a shortest path algorithm, so the agent tries to find the nearest coin or crate. First we had to think about a data structure that can handle an \textit{A* search} efficiently. For this we needed a node structure, so we created the following class
